# **CarrotSweeper Backup Scripts**
These are the old scripts used for image processing, principal components
analysis (PCA), and PCA sweeping. For this version, I just copy-pasted the
functions from HypoQuantyl (HQ). This meant that any changes/fixes I fixed from
HQ would need to be changed in these scripts as well. This is obviously messy
and inefficient. It would also cause a lot of problems with my MATLAB path, as
it would be difficult to know whether you're calling the HQ or CS versions.

For the most recent update [ as of 10/31/2018 ], I simply created hard-links of
the same scripts [ found in the _'dependencies'_ text file in this repo's main
directory ] instead. Given that nobody in the world would probably need both
CarrotSweeper and HypoQuantyl, this is probably the best workaround for this
issue.
